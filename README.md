# Autonomous-Vehicle-Assistance-Simulation(AVAS)

## Overview

The Autonomous Vehicle Assistance Simulation (AVAS) is an innovative project developed as part of the McMaster Engineering Programming Competition 2023. This simulation is designed to showcase cutting-edge functionalities in autonomous vehicle technology, focusing on route optimization, pedestrian safety, and driver assistance.

## Features

- **Route Optimization:** Utilizes the A* algorithm to optimize routes for minimal energy consumption, catering to the eco-conscious and efficiency-driven aspects of autonomous vehicles.
- **Real-Time Path Calculation:** Provides a dynamic user interface where users can input start and end locations, enabling real-time calculation of the optimal path.
- **Pedestrian Detection:** Incorporates advanced algorithms for detecting pedestrians, significantly enhancing road safety for both pedestrians and drivers.
- **Automated Text Response System:** Features a programmed set of text reply options and a user-friendly call interface to minimize driver distraction, thus enhancing road safety.
- **User Interface:** Developed using JavaScript and p5.js, combined with HTML and CSS for a smooth and interactive user experience.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** JavaScript, p5.js for interactive elements, HTML, and CSS for structuring and styling.
- **Backend:** JavaScript logic for implementing the A* algorithm and pedestrian detection features.
